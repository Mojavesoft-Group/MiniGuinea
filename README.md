MiniGuinea is a simple Chromium extension that:
- Stops dozens of ad providers from serving their ads to your browser; including but not limited to Google Doubleclick, Amazon Advertising, and CoinZilla
- Defeats several different analytics providers, most notably Google Analytics (not fully functional at the moment), Cloudflare Insights, and the United States Digital Analytics Program
- Uses Manifest v3 (if you don't know what this means, don't worry about it)
- Avoids interfering with the user experience as much as possible

MiniGuinea is known to work in Chromium, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. It should function properly in most other Chromium browsers too.

MiniGuinea does not officially support Firefox-based browsers (Firefox, Tor Browser, etc.) at the moment. Firefox support is not planned for the foreseeable future.

*MiniGuinea may fail to block some instances of this tracker, but it stops it most of the time.

** Ghostery appears to be injecting its own script here. More information is needed.

# Known issues
On MiniGuinea v0.1, there is a missing icon file which makes installation impossible. Starting with MiniGuinea v0.2, all of the icon files are in place.

In MiniGuinea versions predating v0.6, you cannot view your Google Analytics dashboard properly. A fix was made during early development, but somehow got dropped from the codebase before v0.1 was released. An improved fix is available in v0.6 and later.

A bug has been discovered in MiniGuinea versions v0.4 through v0.6. A fix will be available in v0.7.
