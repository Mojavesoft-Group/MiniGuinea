# MiniGuinea
MiniGuinea is a simple Chromium extension that:
- Stops dozens of ad providers from serving their ads; including but not limited to Google Doubleclick, Amazon Advertising, and CoinZilla
- Defeats several different analytics providers, most notably Google Analytics (not fully functional at the moment), Cloudflare Insights, and the United States Digital Analytics Program
- Uses Manifest v3 (if you don't know what this means, don't worry about it)
- Avoids interfering with the user experience as much as possible

MiniGuinea is known to work in Chromium, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. It should function properly in most other Chromium browsers too.

MiniGuinea does not officially support Firefox-based browsers (Firefox, Tor Browser, etc.) at the moment. Firefox support is not planned for the foreseeable future.
