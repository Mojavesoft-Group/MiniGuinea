# MiniGuinea
MiniGuinea is a simple Chromium extension that:
- Stops dozens of ad providers from serving their ads; including but not limited to Google Doubleclick, Amazon Advertising, and CoinZilla
- Defeats several different analytics providers, most notably Google Analytics and Cloudflare Insights
- Does not require manual user intervention
- Avoids interfering with the user experience as much as possible

MiniGuinea is not commercialized and does not have an "acceptable ads" policy.

# Basic ideas behind MiniGuinea
The idea that fuels MiniGuinea is very simple. If most people use an adblocker, then there will be little financial incentive for advertising platforms to continue operating. Unfortunately, most of the easy-to-use adblockers participate in conflicts of interest or do not work well in Manifest v3. MiniGuinea solves this issue. It works on most modern Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and requires zero configuration after being installed.

## What's with the name?
The name MiniGuinea is inspired by the _guinea fowl_, a bird renowned for its ability to consume ticks in large numbers. MiniGuinea consumes lots of trackers, hence the name _MiniGuinea_.
